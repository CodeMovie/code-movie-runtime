# Changelog

## 2.1.0

- **Feature:** the new DOM method: `go(targetKeyframe)` can be used as an alternative way to navigate to specific keyframes. The setter `current` does the same thing, but if you'd rather use a method, `go()` has you covered.
- **Improvement:** the element now keeps its slotted content's class names up to date even if that content changes. This should make the element overall more reliable.
- **Feature:** add a changelog!
